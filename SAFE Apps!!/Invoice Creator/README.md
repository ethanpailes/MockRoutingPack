Editable Invoice
==================

<a href="http://invoice.nobackend.org/">

</a>

The very first [noBackend](http://nobackend.org/) example app, to showcase how an HTML prototype can be turned into a real product in a matter of hours.

The code is quite hacky at the moment, we gratefully accept pull requests ;-) 


Vision
------

Besides the current implementation with [Hoodie](http://hood.ie) and [remoteStorage](http://remotestorage.io/) + [sockethub](http://sockethub.org/),
 we want to add implementations with other noBackend solutions, like [deployd](http://deployd.com/), [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) and [Kinvey](http://www.kinvey.com/).

Think of it as [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) for noBackend solutions.
